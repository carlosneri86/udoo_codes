Test app for lab 4.

To execute use:

./ClienteShellPractica <threads> <serverip> <serverport>

threads     = amount of client threads to create
serverip    = remote server IP
server port = remote listening port

Once the threads are created a shell is provided. Current commands available:

disconnect = not implemented
accelerometer <axis> = request an accelerometer axis based on the parameter
magnetometer <axis>  = request a magnetometer axis based on the parameter 
gyroscope <axis>     = request a gyro axis based on the parameter
wrongs               = generates a frame with a wrong sensor parameter
wrongcs              = generates a frame with wrong checksum
wrongax              = generates a frame with a wrong axis parameter
help                 = lists the commands available

Each time a command is executed, each thread shows the response received from
the server.

An 8 seconds delay is added after each command is executed. Enter a new command
just after the command prompt "Cliente>" appears.
