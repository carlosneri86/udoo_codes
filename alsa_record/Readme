In order to run this example, first install the following packages:

   apt-get install libasound2 alsa-utils alsa-oss libasound2-dev

And figure out the sound cards available on your device using:

    arecord -l

The application will record and generate a  5 seconds Wave file 
from the device, sampling rate and channels specified.

Note that for Wave there's no error checking.

An example of how to use it:

./alsa_record.out hw:0,0 48000 2

Where:

hw:0,0 is the card 0, device 0
48000 is the sampling rate (in Hz)
2 is the channels
